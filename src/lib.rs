//! # Rust driver for MCP4728 4-channel 12-bit I2C DAC
//!
//! This is a platform agnostic rust driver for the MCP4728 DAC using the
//! [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.
//!
//! This driver allows you to:
//!
//! - Write to a single channel and save to EEPROM
//! - Write to multiple channels and save to EEPROM
//! - Write to all channels, skipping some configuration bits and not saving to EEPROM ("fast
//!   write")
//! - Write voltage reference mode to all channels
//! - Write gain mode to all channels
//! - Write power down mode to all channels
//! - Read EEPROM and output registers for all channels
//! - Issue I2C General Call commands: reset, wake up, and software update
//!
//! There is one feature that this driver does **not** support - reading and writing the I2C address
//! of the device. Three bits of the driver can be set (from 0x60 to 0x67) but this is done by
//! toggling another pin in precise timing with the I2C message, which is not possible to do using
//! the [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.
//!
//! This crate is `#![no_std]` and does not contain unsafe code.
//!
//! ## Device
//!
//! The MCP4728 is a 4-channel, 12-bit digital-to-analog converter with nonvolatile memory (EEPROM)
//! for its output settings. The device will load its previous setting from EEPROM on startup
//! without receiving any commands. Each channel has separate voltage reference, gain, and power
//! down settings. Channels can be written individually or together.
//!
//! ### Datasheet
//!
//! [MCP4728](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22187E.pdf)
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(target_os = "linux")] {
//! use linux_embedded_hal::I2cdev;
//! use mcp4728::{MCP4728};
//!
//! let i2c = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
//! let mut dac = MCP4728::new(i2c, 0x60);
//! dac.fast_write(483, 279, 297, 590).unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Updating the analog outputs
//!
//! Most commands write to the output register but do not necessarily update the analog output.
//! There are several ways to do so:
//!
//! - If `OutputEnableMode` is `Update`, the output will be updated after the last byte is received
//!   for each channel (not all commands can set this bit)
//! - If the LDAC pin is set low, the output will be updated after the last byte is received for
//!   each channel.
//! - If the LDAC pin transitions from high to low at any time, all channels will be updated.
//! - If a General Call Software Update command is received, all channels will be updated.
